One day, Kamila came across a group of girls playing under a majestic tree. Their names were Zahra, Fatema, and Areej. They were picking flowers and singing songs of cheerfulness. Kamila joined them, and together they created a beautiful melody that echoed through the garden.

As they continued their joyful activities, a young girl named Jasmin appeared. She had recently arrived from a distant land called Hind. Jasmin was amazed by the peaceful atmosphere and the beauty of the garden. She shared stories of her homeland, bringing a sense of unity among them.

Deep in the garden, they discovered a hidden oasis named Firdaus. Its crystal-clear water reflected the moonlight, creating a mesmerizing sight. The girls sat by the water, captivated by its radiance. They began to share their dreams and aspirations, inspiring one another to reach for the heights.

As they spent more time together, a strong bond formed among the girls. They named their group "Mawhib," symbolizing their unique abilities and virtues. The Mawhib girls became ambassadors of peace, spreading kindness, balance, and trust in the garden and beyond.

Word of their friendship and harmonious ways reached the queen of the garden, Malika. Impressed by their unity, Malika invited the Mawhib girls to her palace, where they met Queen Bilqis from a distant land. Bilqis, a wise and powerful queen, praised their commitment to peace and named them the "Houriya," representing their eternal essence of vitality and purity.

The Houriya continued to bring joy and enlightenment to others, inspiring them to find their own balance and radiance. Their story of unity and peaceful coexistence became a legend, reminding people of the beauty that lies in diversity and the importance of cherishing one another.

And so, the Houriya's tale of friendship, peace, and enlightenment continued to be shared, spreading happiness throughout the garden of Janna and beyond, forever reminding everyone of the power of love and harmony.
