# Muslim_Names_Recognizer
Muslim Names Recognizer is a model that is trained using SpaCy. It serves the purpose to recognize Muslim Names Entity. 
Example: Dialogflow Default entity of Persons Names doesn't recognize Muslim names properly so this model is helpful.
Note: This model is trained on a demo file (generated by the chatbot). There is a need to train this model on more data to get the best results.
Currently, this model is able to recognize very few Muslim names.
